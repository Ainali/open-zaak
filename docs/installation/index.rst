Installation
============

There are several ways to install Open Zaak. A scalable solution is to use
:ref:`Kubernetes<deployment_kubernetes>`. You can also run the
:ref:`Docker containers<deployment_containers>` on a single machine. Expert users can
deploy everything on a :ref:`linux machine<deployment_linux>` directly.

Make sure to check out the :ref:`hardware requirements<installation_hardware>` first.
